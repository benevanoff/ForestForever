Our final project implements Unity's built-in "Test Runner" to build our unit testing.
Basically, Unity utilizes two types of tests: "EditMode" and "PlayMode" testing.

EditMode - tests scripts outside of the game runtime environment
PlayMode - tests game functionality/scripts within the game runtime environment

Each individual folder contains test results generated by our unit test code which can be located
at: \final-project-segfaultcoredumped\unity-folder\project\Assets\Tests

Template Command Line: Unity.exe -runTests -batchmode -projectPath [Project Directory] -testResults [Save Directory] -testPlatform [EditMode/PlayMode]
Command Line Used Locally: Unity.exe -runTests -batchmode -projectPath C:\Users\safeer\cs128env\src\fp\final-project-segfaultcoredumped\unity-folder\project -testResults C:\Users\safeer\cs128env\src\fp\final-project-segfaultcoredumped\unity-folder\unit-testing\edit-mode-results\results.xml -testPlatform editmode
