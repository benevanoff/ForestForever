Our final project implements Unity's built-in "Test Runner" to build our unit testing.
Basically, Unity utilizes two types of tests: "EditMode" and "PlayMode" testing.

EditMode - tests scripts outside of the game runtime environment
PlayMode - tests game functionality/scripts within the game runtime environment

Each individual folder contains test results generated by our unit test code which can be located
at: \final-project-segfaultcoredumped\unity-folder\project\Assets\Tests
